# Color_Card_Web_Game_P2P

A real-time, peer-to-peer (P2P) multiplayer card game inspired by color-matching mechanics.  
Players can log in, create or join a game room, chat in the lobby, and play against friends directly through their browsers without a central server.

## Description
Color_Card_Web_Game_P2P is a browser-based card game with gameplay similar to popular color-matching games, but built entirely with open code and assets.  
It runs over a peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC via PeerJS, enabling direct communication between players across the internet.

## Objective
This project was developed for academic purposes only to demonstrate:
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) connections in web applications.
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay using WebRTC.
- Interactive UI updates through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Structure and layout
- CSS3 – Styling and responsive design
- JavaScript (Vanilla) – Game logic and UI interactions
- PeerJS – Simplified WebRTC connections
- GitHub Pages – Hosting and HTTPS delivery

## Installation & Usage
1. Online (GitHub Pages)  
   - Visit the hosted version link (when GitHub Pages is enabled).

2. Local  
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/alejandromarin0313/Color_Card_Web_Game_P2P.git
     ```
   - Open `index.html` in your browser (for P2P features to work locally, use `localhost` or an HTTPS server).
